    <h1>NICHOLAS P. TATONETTI</h1>
    <p>
      Dr. Nicholas Tatonetti is Vice Chair of Operations in the Department of Computational Biomedicine and Associate Director of Computational Oncology in the Cancer Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He received his PhD from Stanford University where he focused on the development of novel statistical and computational methods for observational data mining. Over the past 14 years, he has applied these methods to drug safety surveillance and the discovery of dangerous adverse drug effects and has identified and validated previously unknown serious drug-drug interactions. His lab at Cedars-Sinai is focused on using massive-scale real clinical and molecular data for making robust and validated scientific discoveries, with a particular focus on detecting, explaining, and validating drug effects and drug interactions. Dr. Tatonetti has published over 130 peer-reviewed scientific publications across medicine, systems biology, machine learning, and bioinformatics. He is passionate about the integration of real-world data (such as those stored in the electronic health records) and high-dimensional biological data (captured using next-generation sequencing, high-throughput screening, and other "omics" technologies) to reimagine and rescale the scientific method.

		NICHOLAS P. TATONETTI is Associate Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University with interdisciplinary appointments in the Department of Systems Biology and the Department of Medicine. He received a Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford University in 2012, and dual B.S. degrees from Arizona State University in computational mathematics and molecular biosciences/biotechnology in 2008. Dr. Tatonetti's research is focused on advancing our understanding of drug effects and drug combinations through the integration of observational clinical data and high-throughput molecular data. A recognized expert in adverse drug effects, Dr. Tatonetti is responsible for discovering previously unexpected drug interactions causing heart arrhythmias and glucose dysregulation.

		Dr. Tatonetti is an Irving Scholar, a Kavli Fellow, the recipient of New Investigator Awards from the American Medical Informatics Association (2016) and the PhRMA Foundation (2014), and has been awarded over $4 million in research funding. His work has received multiple awards in informatics and data science in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016. Dr. Tatonetti's career has been profiled by Science Magazine (2011), Genome Web (2012), and AMIA (2016). He is author on over 90 peer-reviewed scientific publics, inventor on two patents, and his work as been covered by the popular and scientific press, including The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, and The Boston Globe.

      Dr. Nicholas Tatonetti trained in mathematics and molecular biology at Arizona State University before receiving his PhD in biomedical informatics in 2012 from Stanford University. His dissertation was focused on the development of novel statistical and computational methods for observational data mining. He applied these methods to drug safety surveillance where he discovered and validated new drug effects and interactions. In September 2012, Dr. Tatonetti joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Biomedical Informatics, Systems Biology, and Medicine. Shortly after, he became Director for the Clinical Informatics Shared Resource (CISR) at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center. His lab at Columbia is focused on expanding upon his previous work in detecting, explaining, and validating drug effects and drug interactions from large-scale observational data.

    Widely published in both clinical and bioinformatics, Dr. Tatonetti is passionate about the integration of hospital data (stored in the electronic health records) and high-dimensional biological data (captured using next-generation sequencing, high-throughput screening, and other "omics" technologies). His lab develops the algorithms, techniques, and methods for analyzing enormous and diverse data by designing rigorous computational and mathematical approaches that address the fundamental challenges of observational analysis- bias and confounding. Foremost, they integrate medical observations with systems and chemical biology models to, not only, explain clinical effects, but also further our understanding basic biology and human disease. Dr. Tatonetti has been featured by the New York Times, Genome Web, and Science Careers. His work has been picked up by the mainstream and scientific media and generated thousands of news articles.
