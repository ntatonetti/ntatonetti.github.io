Yet serum creatinine (sCr) is a marker of both functional and pathological processes and does not specifically assay tubular injury. In addition, sCr may require days to reach diagnostic thresholds, yet tubular cells respond with programs of damage and repair within minutes or hours. To detect acute responses to clinically relevant stimuli, we created Rosa26-floxed-stop uracil phosphoribosyl-transferase (Uprt) expressing mice and inoculated 4-thiouracil (TU) to tag nascent RNA at selected time points. Cre-driven TU-tagged RNA was isolated from whole kidneys and demonstrated that volume depletion and ischemia induced different genetic programs. Even lineage related cell types expressed different genes in response to the two stressors. TU-tagging also demonstrated the transient nature of the responses. Because we placed Uprt in the ubiquitously active Rosa-26 locus, RNAs from many cell types can be tagged in vivo and their roles interrogated under various conditions. In short, TU labeling identifies stimulus-specific, cell-specific, and time-dependent acute responses that are otherwise difficult to detect with other technologies and are entirely obscured when sCr is the sole metric of kidney damage.","",""

Briefly, the model takes drugs’ chemical structures as inputs to predict their target, enzyme, and transporter (TET) profiles, which are subsequently utilized to assess occurrences of ADRs, with an overall accuracy of ~91%. The robustness of the model for ADR classification was validated with DDIs involving three widely prescribed drugs.

EHRs are becoming an important depository of patient health information and can capture family data. Pedigree analysis is a longstanding and powerful approach that can gain insight into the underlying genetic and environmental factors in human health, but traditional approaches to identifying and recruiting families are low-throughput and labor-intensive. Therefore, high-throughput methods to automatically construct family pedigrees are needed.   RESULTS We developed a stand-alone application: Electronic Pedigrees, or E-Pedigrees, which combines two validated family prediction algorithms into a single software package for high throughput pedigrees construction. The convenient platform considers patients' basic demographic information and/or emergency contact data to infer high-accuracy parent-child relationship. Importantly, E-Pedigrees allows users to layer in additional pedigree data when available and provides options for applying different logical rules to improve accuracy of inferred family relationships. This software is fast and easy to use, is compatible with different EHR data sources, and its output is a standard PED file appropriate for multiple downstream analyses.

We combined clinical, transcriptomic, computational, and experimental strategies to explore lipid-lowering and plaque-stabilizing effects of atypical antidepressant trazodone.Methods. First, a connectivity mapping strategy was used to match rosuvastatin gene expression signature derived from a clinical trial of 85 patients with to the expression patterns of 1,309 different small molecules to discover a similarity between the rosuvastatin and trazodone gene expression signatures. Then, we assessed the lipid-lowering ability of trazodone in vitro using HepG2 cells and in vivo using molecular imaging of rabbit atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, we analyzed electronic medical records of patients from three large medical centers who had a prescription for trazodone and lipid laboratory measurements available.Results. Trazodone significantly reduced cholesterol levels in the HepG2 human hepatocyte model, decreased atherosclerotic plaque burden in a rabbit model and lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients.Conclusion. Our results indicate that trazodone may be a promising candidate for adjunctive lipid lowering therapy.

Methods In this retrospective study, we used survival analysis to determine whether or not mortality following intubation was associated with hormone exposure in patients treated at New York Presbyterian/ Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Here, we report the overall hazards ratio for each hormone for exposure before and after intubation for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.  Results Among the 189,987 patients, we identified 948 intubation periods across 791 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or infected with SARS-CoV2 and 3,497 intubation periods across 2,981 patients who were not. Melatonin exposure after intubation was statistically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.131, 95% CI: 7.76E-02 - 0.223, p-value = 8.19E-14) and non-COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.278, 95% CI: 0.142 - 0.542, p-value = 1.72E-04) intubated patients.

Given the rapid emergence of this pathogen, little is known about its genetic variation, immune system interactions, population prevalence, and environmental distribution. As a result, there is a pressing clinical and public health need for scalable molecular technologies that can rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and robustly interrogate strain evolution and host response in patients. To address these challenges, we designed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection within 30 minutes of application, including directly from lysed cells. Simultaneously, we developed a large-scale host and viral transcriptomic profiling platform that employs total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Applying both technologies to 442 samples, spanning 338 clinical samples tested for SARS-CoV-2, 86 environmental samples from the NYC subway, and 14 controls, we assembled a broad molecular picture of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC. We found close concordance between viral titers measured with our rapid LAMP assay, RNA-seq, and the state-of-the-art RT-PCR. Full transcriptomic analyses revealed a distinct subset of the Western European clade A2a as the predominant genomic subtype in NYC cases, which was defined by two single nucleotide variants in nsp2 and ORF 3a and a clade-specific, 9-bp in-frame deletion in the virulence factor nsp1. High SARS-CoV2 viral titers were associated with distinct host transcriptional responses, including activation of the ACE2 gene and interferon response genes (e.g., IFIT1). Since ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) can also increase ACE2 expression, outcomes for patients taking ACEIs were examined, and showed a significantly increased risk of intubation and death. Our results demonstrate the utility of two molecular diagnostic platforms in defining the genetic features of an evolving global pandemic and provide insights that can aid future COVID-19 diagnostics, public health monitoring, and therapeutic options.","",""

There are increasing reports of polymyxin resistance emerging, raising concerns of a postantibiotic era. Polymyxin resistance is therefore a significant public health threat, but current phenotypic methods for detection are difficult and time-consuming to perform. There have been increasing efforts to use whole-genome sequencing for detection of antibiotic resistance, but this has been difficult to apply to polymyxin resistance because of its complex polygenic nature. The significance of our research is that we successfully applied machine learning methods to predict polymyxin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal group 258, a common health care-associated and multidrug-resistant pathogen. Our findings highlight that machine learning can be successfully applied even in complex forms of antibiotic resistance and represent a significant contribution to the literature that could be used to predict resistance in other bacteria and to other antibiotics. ABSTRACT Polymyxins are used as treatments of last resort for Gram-negative bacterial infections. Their increased use has led to concerns about emerging polymyxin resistance (PR). Phenotypic polymyxin susceptibility testing is resource intensive and difficult to perform accurately. The complex polygenic nature of PR and our incomplete understanding of its genetic basis make it difficult to predict PR using detection of resistance determinants. We therefore applied machine learning (ML) to whole-genome sequencing data from >600 Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal group 258 (CG258) genomes to predict phenotypic PR. Using a reference-based representation of genomic data with ML outperformed a rule-based approach that detected variants in known PR genes (area under receiver-operator curve [AUROC], 0.894 versus 0.791, P = 0.006). We noted modest increases in performance by using a bacterial genome-wide association study to filter relevant genomic features and by integrating clinical data in the form of prior polymyxin exposure. Conversely, reference-free representation of genomic data as k-mers was associated with decreased performance (AUROC, 0.692 versus 0.894, P = 0.015). When ML models were interpreted to extract genomic features, six of seven known PR genes were correctly identified by models without prior programming and several genes involved in stress responses and maintenance of the cell membrane were identified as potential novel determinants of PR. These findings are a proof of concept that whole-genome sequencing data can accurately predict PR in K. pneumoniae CG258 and may be applicable to other forms of complex antimicrobial resistance. IMPORTANCE Polymyxins are last-resort antibiotics used to treat highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

Large-scale secondary data reuse of notes in electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to increase the quantity and quality of symptom research. However, the symptom language used in clinical notes is complex. A need exists for methods designed specifically to identify and study symptom information from EHR notes.   OBJECTIVES We aim to describe a method that combines standardized vocabularies, clinical expertise, and natural language processing to generate comprehensive symptom vocabularies and identify symptom information in EHR notes. We piloted this method with five diverse symptom concepts: constipation, depressed mood, disturbed sleep, fatigue, and palpitations.   METHODS First, we obtained synonym lists for each pilot symptom concept from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Then, we used two large bodies of text (clinical notes from Columbia University Irving Medical Center and PubMed abstracts containing Medical Subject Headings or keywords related to the pilot symptoms) to further expand our initial vocabulary of synonyms for each pilot symptom concept. We used NimbleMiner, an open-source natural language processing tool, to accomplish these tasks and evaluated NimbleMiner symptom identification performance by comparison to a manually annotated set of nurse- and physician-authored common EHR note types.   RESULTS Compared to the baseline UMLS synonym lists, we identified up to 11 times more additional synonym words or expressions, including abbreviations, misspellings, and unique multiword combinations, for each symptom concept. Natural language processing system symptom identification performance was excellent.   DISCUSSION Using our comprehensive symptom vocabularies and NimbleMiner to label symptoms in clinical notes produced excellent performance metrics. The ability to extract symptom information from EHR notes in an accurate and scalable manner has the potential to greatly facilitate symptom science research.","",""

To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients - effects that could not be explained by age or sex. In addition, using data from the UK Biobank, we implemented a candidate driven approach to evaluate linkage between severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and genetic variation associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Among our findings, our scan identified previously reported eQTLs for CD55 (a negative regulator of complement activation) and SNPs in Complement Factor H (CFH) and Complement Component 4 Binding Protein Alpha (C4BPA), which play central roles in complement activation and innate immunity and were previously linked to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to several putative genetic markers of susceptibility.

Medication exposure was reviewed. Results A total of 5409 Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) patients and 2046 Northwell Health patients were identified using one ICD code for SLE. Of 7455 patients, three had an ICD code for PML. On EMR review, however, PML was substantiated in only one fatal SLE case with significant immunosuppressant use and severe lymphopenia (<0.5 cells x 109/L); one patient was evaluated for PML but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for JC virus and improved with treatment of central nervous system (CNS) lupus. EMR data were very limited for the third patient and diagnosis could not be confirmed. None of the 13 342 patients with RA ICD codes had PML. Of the 5409 patients with an SLE ICD code at CUMC, 212 also had a renal transplant ICD code, and 83 had concomitant HIV/AIDS. Based on inpatient pharmacy records of 5409 hospitalised patients at CUMC, 59.2% were treated with steroids, and 16.09% with immunosuppressants (7.76% mycophenolate, 3.42% cyclophosphamide, 2.88% azathioprine and 2.03% rituximab).

Fortunately, myriad new tools have now been developed to better understand the relationship between acute tubular injury and elevation in serum creatinine (SCr). These tools include unbiased gene and protein expression analyses in kidney, urine and blood, the localization of specific gene transcripts in pathological biopsy samples by rapid in-situ RNA technology and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses. However, this molecular approach to AKI has produced a series of unexpected problems, because the expression of specific kidney-derived molecules that are indicative of injury often do not correlate with SCr levels. This discrepancy between kidney injury markers and SCr level can be reconciled by the recognition that many separate subtypes of AKI exist, each with distinct patterning of molecular markers of tubular injury and SCr data. In this Review, we describe the weaknesses of isolated SCr-based diagnoses, the clinical and molecular subtyping of acute tubular injury, and the role of non-invasive biomarkers in clinical phenotyping. We propose a conceptual model that synthesizes molecular and physiological data along a time course spanning from acute cellular injury to organ failure.Acute kidney injury (AKI) is diagnosed by the serum concentration of creatinine (SCr), an insensitive marker of kidney function. The authors of this Review discuss the properties of ideal biomarkers of tubular damage and how they can be combined with SCr-based AKI definitions to provide greater insights into the processes underlying acute tubular injury.Key pointsCurrent definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI), based on serum creatinine (SCr) level, focus on loss of kidney function rather than kidney injury.AKI definitions cannot provide an acute measurement of loss of function, however, because SCr is a quantitative functional marker only at the steady state.Current AKI metrics can neither detect kidney injury in real time nor distinguish dramatically different types of kidney injury.Molecular analyses of acutely damaged kidneys have detected cellular and segment-specific responses to injurious stimuli, prior to and distinct from the loss of function as measured by SCr.As a result, molecular analyses have detected different types of acute tubular injury and have re-characterized the concept of the kidney response to noxious stimuli into biomarker-positive ʻinjury’ and biomarker-negative ʻno injury’.A conceptual model places ʻtubular injury’ (biomarkers) upstream of ʻloss of function’ (AKI metrics), providing a unifying ʻinjury’ and ʻloss of function’ sequence consistent with biological pathways.","",""

The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) standardizes the language and structure of EHR data to promote interoperability of EHR data for research. While the OMOP CDM is valuable and more attuned to research purposes, it still requires extensive domain knowledge to utilize effectively, potentially limiting more widespread adoption of EHR data for research and quality improvement. Materials and methods We have created ROMOP: an R package for direct interfacing with EHR data in the OMOP CDM format. Results ROMOP streamlines typical EHR-related data processes. Its functions include exploration of data types, extraction and summarization of patient clinical and demographic data, and patient searches using any CDM vocabulary concept. Conclusion ROMOP is freely available under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license and can be obtained from GitHub (http://github.com/BenGlicksberg/ROMOP). We detail instructions for setup and use in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we provide a public sandbox server containing synthesized clinical data for users to explore OMOP data and ROMOP (http://romop.ucsf.edu).","",""

Estimating heritability, however, requires a laborious recruitment of a large number of relatives. Electronic health records (EHR) contain massive relative information in emergency contact forms. Recently, we presented RIFTEHR, an algorithm for extracting relationships from EHR. Here, we present an updated version and reconstructed 4.2 million familial relationships from the latest New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) EHR system. The number of updated relationships is 30 percent more than the last version. We present a new implementation of RIFTEHR, which runs in linear time, thus largely improves the speed of the algorithm. We also present a data encryption method, to protect patient privacy in running the algorithm. These resources can be used for generalized use of familial relationships from EHR in genetic studies.","",""

Implementation In this paper we present RecNW, an open source C++ exact aligner packaged for Python that implements the semi-global version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with affine gap penalty. RecNW utilizes low complexity of targeted sequencing libraries by aligning only unique reads, and recurrently using blocs of the alignment matrix between reads based on their similarities. Through this, RecNW performs exact alignment on average more than four times faster than gold standard comparable software. Software https://github.com/AYahi/recNW","",""

Predicting patients at risk and leveraging accelerated interventions can reduce the rates of early readmission, a negative clinical outcome (i.e., a treatment failure) that affects the quality of life of patient. To implement individualized interventions, it is necessary to predict those individuals at highest risk for 30-day readmission. In this study, our aim was to conduct a data-driven investigation to find the pharmacological factors influencing 30-day all-cause, intra- and interdepartmental readmissions after an index psychiatric admission, using the compendium of prescription data (prescriptome) from electronic medical records (EMR).MethodsThe data scientists in the project received a deidentified database from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse, which was used to perform all analyses. Data was stored in a secured MySQL database, normalized and indexed using a unique hexadecimal identifier associated with the data for psychiatric illness visits. We used Bayesian logistic regression models to evaluate the association of prescription data with 30-day readmission risk. We constructed individual models and compiled results after adjusting for covariates, including drug exposure, age, and gender. We also performed digital comorbidity survey using EMR data combined with the estimation of shared genetic architecture using genomic annotations to disease phenotypes.ResultsUsing an automated, data-driven approach, we identified prescription medications, side effects (primary side effects), and drug-drug interaction-induced side effects (secondary side effects) associated with readmission risk in a cohort of 1275 patients using prescriptome analytics. In our study, we identified 28 drugs associated with risk for readmission among psychiatric patients. Based on prescription data, Pravastatin had the highest risk of readmission (OR = 13.10; 95% CI (2.82, 60.8)). We also identified enrichment of primary side effects (n = 4006) and secondary side effects (n = 36) induced by prescription drugs in the subset of readmitted patients (n = 89) compared to the non-readmitted subgroup (n = 1186). Digital comorbidity analyses and shared genetic analyses further reveals that cardiovascular disease and psychiatric conditions are comorbid and share functional gene modules (cardiomyopathy and anxiety disorder: shared genes (n = 37; P = 1.06815E-06)).ConclusionsLarge scale prescriptome data is now available from EMRs and accessible for analytics that could improve healthcare outcomes. Such analyses could also drive hypothesis and data-driven research. In this study, we explored the utility of prescriptome data to identify factors driving readmission in a psychiatric cohort. Converging digital health data from EMRs and systems biology investigations reveal a subset of patient populations that have significant comorbidities with cardiovascular diseases are more likely to be readmitted. Further, the genetic architecture of psychiatric illness also suggests overlap with cardiovascular diseases. In summary, assessment of medications, side effects, and drug-drug interactions in a clinical setting as well as genomic information using a data mining approach could help to find factors that could help to lower readmission rates in patients with mental illness.","",""

Left ventricular apex tissue and serum pairs were collected in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy ( n = 25, 23 men and 2 women) at LVAD implantation and after LVAD support at cardiac transplantation/LVAD explantation. Normal cardiac tissue was obtained from healthy hearts ( n = 4) and normal serum from age-matched control hearts ( n = 4). The duration of LVAD support ranged from 48 to 1,170 days (median duration: 270 days). LVAD support was associated with CaMKIIδ activation, increased nuclear myocyte enhancer factor 2, sustained histone deacetylase-4 phosphorylation, increased circulating and cardiac myostatin (MSTN) and MSTN signaling mediated by SMAD2, ongoing structural protein dysregulation and sustained fibrosis and apoptosis (all P < 0.05).

The majority of hospital transmission models describe dynamics on the level of the host rather than on the level of the pathogens themselves. Accordingly, epidemiologists often cannot complete transmission chains without direct evidence of either host–host contact or a large reservoir population. Here, we propose an ecology-based model to explain the transmission of pathogens in hospitals. The model is based upon metapopulation biology, which describes a group of interacting localized populations and island biogeography, which provides a basis for how pathogens may be moving between locales. Computational simulation trials are used to assess the applicability of the model. Results indicate that pathogens survive for extended periods without the need for large reservoirs by living in localized ephemeral populations while continuously transmitting pathogens to new seed populations. Computational simulations show small populations spending significant portions of time at sizes too small to be detected by most surveillance protocols and that the number and type of these ephemeral populations enable the overall pathogen population to be sustained. By modeling hospital pathogens as a metapopulation, many observations characteristic of hospital acquired infection outbreaks for which there has previously been no sufficient biological explanation, including how and why empirically successful interventions work, can now be accounted for using population dynamic hypotheses. Epidemiological links between temporally isolated outbreaks are explained via pathogen population dynamics and potential outbreak intervention targets are identified.","",""

This is often referred as the T1 translational research. The clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD) studies usually translate and sometimes even guide the phases II and III clinical studies. This is called T2 translational research. The T3 translational research focuses on the practice, including comparative effectiveness research, postmarketing studies, and clinical outcome research, whereas T4 translational research deals with population level outcome research, monitoring of morbidity, mortality, benefits, and risk, and impacts of policy and change. Usually, T3 and T4 fall into the pharmacoepidemiology research domain. All T1 to T4 translational researches are very well organized and conducted in most medical centers and pharmaceutical industries. A new type of translational pharmacology research is now being enabled that was not feasible before because of the emergence of big data, especially the increased accessibility of institutional electronic medical records, the availability of health insurance claims data through health information technology commercially, and many public in vitro drug screening data sources. Noticeably, Tatonetti et al. tested and validated a large number of drug interactions in two health record databases. Recently, Chiang et al. conducted the high-dimensional drug interaction discovery using health record databases and evaluated the pharmacology mechanisms of these drug interactions using pharmacokinetic models. Unlike the conventional T1 to T4 translational research, these translational studies, driven by the big data, reversely connect the pharmaco-epidemiology evidences with in vitro pharmacology experiments. In this editorial, we call them “reverse translational pharmacology research.” The early success of this reverse translational pharmacology research is largely due to the fact that biomedical informatics is a powerfully driving force in the current data science era. Biomedical informatics, developed primarily from the data management and analysis needs in the biomedical domains, is fundamentally a translational research field. The innovations of biomedical informatics are motivated from well integrated scientific computing and biomedical research. Here, I would like to point out two challenges that biomedical informatics is facing in the reverse translational pharmacology research. First, the notable early successes of biomedical informatics were directly resulted from our existing computational capability of mining the associations between drugs and adverse drug events (ADEs). In the meantime, a great deal of attention was paid in developing new data mining algorithms that control the confounding variables. However, only limited research has been conducted in selecting proper epidemiology designs using large-scale health record databases. Although there exists extensive literature in pharmacoepidemiology studies, they were designed for specific drugADE hypotheses, not necessarily for data mining. Statistically valid and computational efficient designs are very much needed for the data mining. Second, PK and PD models are well populated in the preclinical experiments, and phases I–III studies; and they are applied to guide study designs. However, their translational potential is limited by their scalability. For example, if hundreds of drug-ADE signals are tested and validated from the health record data sources, how can we evaluate their PK or PD mechanisms through pharmacometric models? We currently cannot analyze them all at the same time because we do not have all the associated PK and PD models right now. We still do not know what data are available from the literature, what are still missing, and what data are not validated yet. This critical knowledge gap shall be filled with additional informatics and pharmacology research. In this special issue of Reverse Translational Research in CPT: Pharmacometrics & System Pharmacology, we further illustrate the challenges and opportunities in various specific pharmacology research areas. Schneider et al. discussed the reverse translational research between veterinary and human medicine; system pharmacology studies in pregnant women by Quinney et al. and Ke et al. reviewed the system pharmacology research in pregnant women; Li et al. evaluated physiologically based pharmacokinetic model-based prediction on the food effect on the oral drug absorption; and Zhang et al. provided extensive review on the reverse translational research in drug interactions.","",""

We seek to uncover distal risk factors underlying these relationships by probing the relationship between global exposure variance and disease risk variance by birth season. Material and Methods This study utilizes electronic health record data from 6 sites representing 10.5 million individuals in 3 countries (United States, South Korea, and Taiwan). We obtained birth month–disease risk curves from each site in a case-control manner. Next, we correlated each birth month–disease risk curve with each exposure. A meta-analysis was then performed of correlations across sites. This allowed us to identify the most significant birth month–exposure relationships supported by all 6 sites while adjusting for multiplicity. We also successfully distinguish relative age effects (a cultural effect) from environmental exposures. Results Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was the only identified relative age association. Our methods identified several culprit exposures that correspond well with the literature in the field. These include a link between first-trimester exposure to carbon monoxide and increased risk of depressive disorder (R = 0.725, confidence interval [95% CI], 0.529-0.847), first-trimester exposure to fine air particulates and increased risk of atrial fibrillation (R = 0.564, 95% CI, 0.363-0.715), and decreased exposure to sunlight during the third trimester and increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (R = −0.816, 95% CI, −0.5767, −0.929). Conclusion A global study of birth month–disease relationships reveals distal risk factors involved in causal biological pathways that underlie them.","",""

Patient readmission rates are relatively high for conditions like heart failure (HF) despite the implementation of high-quality healthcare delivery operation guidelines created by regulatory authorities. Multiple predictive models are currently available to evaluate potential 30-day readmission rates of patients. Most of these models are hypothesis driven and repetitively assess the predictive abilities of the same set of biomarkers as predictive features. In this manuscript, we discuss our attempt to develop a data-driven, electronic-medical record-wide (EMR-wide) feature selection approach and subsequent machine learning to predict readmission probabilities. We have assessed a large repertoire of variables from electronic medical records of heart failure patients in a single center. The cohort included 1,068 patients with 178 patients were readmitted within a 30-day interval (16.66% readmission rate). A total of 4,205 variables were extracted from EMR including diagnosis codes (n=1,763), medications (n=1,028), laboratory measurements (n=846), surgical procedures (n=564) and vital signs (n=4). We designed a multistep modeling strategy using the Naïve Bayes algorithm. In the first step, we created individual models to classify the cases (readmitted) and controls (non-readmitted). In the second step, features contributing to predictive risk from independent models were combined into a composite model using a correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method. All models were trained and tested using a 5-fold cross-validation method, with 70% of the cohort used for training and the remaining 30% for testing. Compared to existing predictive models for HF readmission rates (AUCs in the range of 0.6-0.7), results from our EMR-wide predictive model (AUC=0.78; Accuracy=83.19%) and phenome-wide feature selection strategies are encouraging and reveal the utility of such datadriven machine learning. Fine tuning of the model, replication using multi-center cohorts and prospective clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility would help the adoption of the model as a clinical decision system for evaluating readmission status.","",""

Because mTOR signaling is required for initiation of messenger RNA translation, we hypothesized that cotargeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. We found that a novel PI3K δ isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc-dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3Kδ inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 ε (CK1ε). Targeting CK1ε using a selective chemical inhibitor or short hairpin RNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3Kδ/CK1ε inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib. Targeting CK1ε should become an integral part of therapeutic strategies targeting translation of oncogenes such as c-Myc.","",""

To examine this possibility, we created mouse models of iAKI and vAKI that induced a similar increase in serum creatinine concentration. Using laser microdissection to isolate specific domains of the kidney, followed by RNA sequencing, we found that thousands of genes responded specifically to iAKI or to vAKI, but very few responded to both stimuli. In fact, the activated gene sets comprised different, functionally unrelated signal transduction pathways and were expressed in different regions of the kidney. Moreover, we identified distinctive gene expression patterns in human urine as potential biomarkers of either iAKI or vAKI, but not both. Hence, iAKI and vAKI are biologically unrelated, suggesting that molecular analysis should clarify our current definitions of acute changes in kidney excretory function.","",""

Further, their temporal nature is not fully exploited by current methods, and temporal abstraction was recently used which results in symbolic time intervals representation. We present Maitreya, a framework for the prediction of outcome events that leverages these symbolic time intervals. Using Maitreya, learn predictive models based on the temporal patterns in the clinical records that are prognostic markers and use these markers to train predictive models for eight clinical procedures. In order to decrease the number of patterns that are used as features, we propose the use of three one class feature selection methods. We evaluate the performance of Maitreya under several parameter settings, including the one-class feature selection, and compare our results to that of atemporal approaches. In general, we found that the use of temporal patterns outperformed the atemporal methods, when representing the number of pattern occurrences.","",""

In this regard, there is a need for more research on how to integrate multiple disparate evidence sources while making the evidence computable from a knowledge representation perspective (i.e., semantic enrichment). Existing frameworks suggest well-promising outcomes for such integration but employ a rather limited number of sources. In particular, none have been specifically designed to support both regulatory and clinical use cases, nor have any been designed to add new resources and use cases through an open architecture. This paper discusses the architecture and functionality of a system called Large-scale Adverse Effects Related to Treatment Evidence Standardization (LAERTES) that aims to address these shortcomings. Results LAERTES provides a standardized, open, and scalable architecture for linking evidence sources relevant to the association of drugs with health outcomes of interest (HOIs). Standard terminologies are used to represent different entities. For example, drugs and HOIs are represented in RxNorm and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms respectively. At the time of this writing, six evidence sources have been loaded into the LAERTES evidence base and are accessible through prototype evidence exploration user interface and a set of Web application programming interface services. This system operates within a larger software stack provided by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics clinical research framework, including the relational Common Data Model for observational patient data created by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership. Elements of the Linked Data paradigm facilitate the systematic and scalable integration of relevant evidence sources. Conclusions The prototype LAERTES system provides useful functionality while creating opportunities for further research. Future work will involve improving the method for normalizing drug and HOI concepts across the integrated sources, aggregated evidence at different levels of a hierarchy of HOI concepts, and developing more advanced user interface for drug-HOI investigations.","",""

Design Computational modeling study. Methods The majority of HAI transmission models describe dynamics on the level of the host rather than on the level of the pathogens themselves. Accordingly, epidemiologists often cannot complete transmission chains without direct evidence of either host-host contact or large reservoir populations. Here, we propose an ecology-based model to explain the transmission of pathogens in hospitals. The model is based upon metapopulation biology, which describes a group of interacting localized populations and island biogeography, which provides a basis for how pathogens may be moving between locales. Computational simulation trials are used to assess the applicability of the model. Results Results indicate that pathogens survive for extended periods without the need for large reservoirs by living in localized ephemeral populations while continuously transmitting pathogens to new seed populations. Computational simulations show small populations spending significant portions of time at sizes too small to be detected by most surveillance protocols. The number and type of these ephemeral populations enable the overall pathogen population to be sustained. Conclusions By modeling hospital pathogens as a metapopulation, observations characteristic of hospital acquired infection outbreaks for which there has previously been no sufficient biological explanation, including how and why empirically successful interventions work, can now be accounted for using population dynamic hypotheses. Epidemiological links between temporally isolated outbreaks are explained via pathogen population dynamics and potential outbreak intervention targets are identified.","",""

Tatonetti contends that this recent attention highlights a long-standing truth: Native American Literature was, as she puts it, “always already queer” (xii). In order to support this claim, Tatonetti draws on foundational ideas from Native American Studies, queer theory, and critical race and diaspora studies. With theory in tow, she shows, on the one hand, how many Native and non-Native writers and filmmakers have fostered divides between LGBTIQ2 and reservation communities and between identification as non-straight and Native. On the other hand, she shows how several two-spirit and queer Native writers have contributed to Native American literature since the so-called Native American Renaissance. This latter group of writers, she argues, have aided in the healing of colonial traumas or, as Beth Brant puts it in Tatonetti’s epigraph, helped “merg[e] the selves that colonialism splits apart.” Tatonetti’s first chapter provides a genealogy of late twentieth-century Native American creative writing and criticism, which illustrates how Native American and gay and lesbian literature and their fields of studies have alternatively effaced and embraced each other in the last four decades. Tatonetti lays out this relationship in a way that offers hints for upcoming writers and editors as she discusses the history behind prose and poetry by a range of authors and elaborates on the effects of canon formation. Readers who already know about both fields may find this first chapter to be a rehashing, and those interested in in-depth literary analysis may wish for this genealogy to be structured around an anchoring author or work. The second chapter provides focused, contextualized literary analysis. Tatonetti reads the 1970s poetry of Maurice Kenny (Mohawk) in the publication Fag Rag in a way that will make many readers think differently about Kenny’s oeuvre, gay periodicals of the era, and queer Native literary history. Tatonetti is right to refer to this chapter as “an archival recovery that functions as a re-membering of the 1970s” (27). Tatonetti’s readings of Kenny’s poetry are particularly revealing because she reads the poems based on their context: the publication’s predominantly white-oriented images and articles. This chapter also illustrates how Native queer poetry, if properly contextualized, can help us","",""

However, their use may lead to unintended, negative medical outcomes commonly referred to as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These effects vary widely in mechanism, severity, and populations affected, making ADR prediction and identification important public health concerns. Current methods rely on clinical trials and postmarket surveillance programs to find novel ADRs; however, clinical trials are limited by small sample size, whereas postmarket surveillance methods may be biased and inherently leave patients at risk until sufficient clinical evidence has been gathered. Systems pharmacology, an emerging interdisciplinary field combining network and chemical biology, provides important tools to uncover and understand ADRs and may mitigate the drawbacks of traditional methods. In particular, network analysis allows researchers to integrate heterogeneous data sources and quantify the interactions between biological and chemical entities. Recent work in this area has combined chemical, biological, and large‐scale observational health data to predict ADRs in both individual patients and global populations. In this review, we explore the rapid expansion of systems pharmacology in the study of ADRs. We enumerate the existing methods and strategies and illustrate progress in the field with a model framework that incorporates crucial data elements, such as diet and comorbidities, known to modulate ADR risk. Using this framework, we highlight avenues of research that may currently be underexplored, representing opportunities for future work.

Over 40 drugs with both cardiac and non-cardiac indications are associated with increased risk of TdP, but drug–drug interactions contributing to LQTS (QT-DDIs) remain poorly characterized. Traditional methods for mining observational healthcare data are poorly equipped to detect QT-DDI signals due to low reporting numbers and lack of direct evidence for LQTS.ObjectiveWe hypothesized that LQTS could be identified latently using an adverse event (AE) fingerprint of more commonly reported AEs. We aimed to generate an integrated data science pipeline that addresses current limitations by identifying latent signals for QT-DDIs in the US FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and retrospectively validating these predictions using electrocardiogram data in electronic health records (EHRs).MethodsWe trained a model to identify an AE fingerprint for risk of TdP for single drugs and applied this model to drug pair data to predict novel DDIs. In the EHR at Columbia University Medical Center, we compared the QTc intervals of patients prescribed the flagged drug pairs with patients prescribed either drug individually.ResultsWe created an AE fingerprint consisting of 13 latently detected side effects. This model significantly outperformed a direct evidence control model in the detection of established interactions (p = 1.62E−3) and significantly enriched for validated QT-DDIs in the EHR (p = 0.01). Of 889 pairs flagged in FAERS, eight novel QT-DDIs were significantly associated with prolonged QTc intervals in the EHR and were not due to co-prescribed medications.ConclusionsLatent signal detection in FAERS validated using the EHR presents an automated and data-driven approach for systematically identifying novel QT-DDIs.

Therefore, the development of signaling methods to use with post-approval AE databases appears vital to comprehensively assess real-world drug safety. However, with millions of potential drug–AE pairs to analyze, the issue of focus is daunting.ObjectiveOur objective was to develop a signaling platform that focuses on AEs with historically demonstrated regulatory interest and to analyze such AEs with a disproportional reporting method that offers broad signal detection and acceptable false-positive rates.MethodsWe analyzed over 1500 US FDA regulatory actions (safety communications and drug label changes) from 2008 to 2015 to construct a list of eligible signal AEs. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was used to evaluate disproportional reporting rates, constrained by minimum case counts and confidence interval limits, of these selected AEs for 109 training drugs. This step led to 45 AEs that appeared to have a low likelihood of being added to a label by FDA, so they were removed from the signal eligible list. We measured disproportional reporting for the final group of eligible AEs on a test group of 29 drugs that were not used in either the eligible list construction or the training steps.ResultsIn a group of 29 test drugs, our model reduced the number of potential drug–AE signals from 41,834 to 97 and predicted 73 % of individual drug label changes. The model also predicted at least one AE–drug pair label change in 66 % of all the label changes for the test drugs.ConclusionsBy concentrating on AE types with already demonstrated interest to FDA, we constructed a signaling system that provided focus regarding drug–AE pairs and suitable accuracy with regard to the issuance of FDA labeling changes.

RESULTS We found that tissue-specificity plays a crucial part in the function of GPCR signaling system. Only a few GPCRs are expressed in each tissue, which are coupled by different combinations of G-proteins or β-arrestins to trigger specific downstream pathways. Based on this finding, we predicted the downstream pathways of GPCR in human tissues and validated our results with L1000 knockdown data. In total, we identified 154,988 connections between 294 GPCRs and 690 pathways in 240 tissues and cell types.

However, no direct inhibitor of c-Myc has been successfully developed for the treatment of any cancer. The c-Myc protein has a short half-life of less than 30 minutes , and the complex secondary structures in the 59 untranslated region (UTR) of MYC mRNA make its translation highly dependent on the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) . eIF4F exists as a complex comprised of the eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G subunits. eIF4E can be sequestered by 4E-BP1, which acts as a ""brake"" for initiation of mRNA translation . Hyper-phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, caused by upstream signals such as mTORC1, leads to release of eIF4E from 4E-BP1, assembly of the eIF4F complex, and robust mRNA translation. Surprisingly, neither FDA approved mTORC1 inhibitors nor the investigational mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor MLN0128 has demonstrated adequate activity in aggressive lymphoma. The therapeutic effects of mTOR inhibition in c-Myc driven aggressive lymphoma remain poorly understood. Recognizing phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the proteasome pathway are both involved in activating mTOR, we hypothesized that co-targeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. Since both PI3K and proteasome are proven drug targets in blood cancer, such co-targeting strategy may be expeditiously studied in clinical trials for c-Myc driven aggressive lymphoma. Methods: Cytotoxicity was studied in lymphoma cell lines and primary lymphoma cells using Cell TiterGlo (Promega®). The Bliss additivism model was used to determine the expected inhibition of cell growth and the excess over Bliss (EOB) values. EOB values above 0 indicate synergy, with higher values indicating higher levels of synergy. Expression of c-Myc was investigated at the translation and transcription levels, using a combination of Western blot, qPCR, and a bi-cistronic luciferase reporter we developed to study cap dependent translation. Gene expression profiling (GEP) studies were conducted using RNAseq, and analyzed by the Fisher t-test and running enrichment score (RES) between different treatment groups. Mechanisms of synergy were determined through interrogating the effects of small molecule inhibitors and shRNA targeting regulators of various regulators of 4E-BP1. Structural studies of TGR-1202 were performed by in silico docking, and validated by synthesis of novel analogs of TGR-1202. Activity of TGR-1202 on CK1 epsilon was studied by kinome profiling (Reaction Biology®), cell free kinase assay of CK1e (Promega®), and cell based assay of CK1e autophosphorylation. Results: We found that a novel PI3K delta isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3Kd inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells (Figure 1). TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc dependent transcription (Figure 2). Furthermore, the synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3Kd inhibitors, was active against casein kinase-1 (CK1) epsilon (Figure 3). Targeting CK1e using a selective chemical inhibitor or shRNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. Conclusion: These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a first-in-class dual PI3Kd/CK1e inhibitor, which may in part explain the preliminary clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib. Targeting CK1e should become an integral part of therapeutic strategies targeting translation of oncogenes such as c-Myc.

The Hill coefficient, nH, which measures the steepness of a dose-response relationship, may be a useful gauge of this therapeutic window. We sought to measure the Hill coefficient of available anticoagulants to gain insight into their therapeutic windows. We used a simple fluorometric in vitro assay to determine clotting activity in platelet poor plasma after exposure to various concentrations of anticoagulants. The Hill coefficient for argatroban was the lowest, at 1.7 ± 0.2 (95% confidence interval, CI), and the Hill coefficient for fondaparinux was the highest, at 4.5 ± 1.3 (95% CI). Thus, doubling the dose of fondaparinux from its IC50 would decrease coagulation activity by nearly a half, whereas doubling the dose of argatroban from its IC50 would decrease coagulation activity by merely one quarter. These results show a significant variation among the Hill coefficients, suggesting a similar variation in therapeutic windows among anticoagulants in our assay.","",""

We found that a novel PI3K delta isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR1202, but not other PI3Kδ inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 (CK1) epsilon. Targeting CK1ε using a selective chemical inhibitor or shRNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3Kδ/CK1ε inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib.

Methods We developed a hypothesis-free method that minimizes publication and disease selection biases by systematically investigating disease-birth month patterns across all conditions. Our dataset includes 1 749 400 individuals with records at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center born between 1900 and 2000 inclusive. We modeled associations between birth month and 1688 diseases using logistic regression. Significance was tested using a chi-squared test with multiplicity correction. Results We found 55 diseases that were significantly dependent on birth month. Of these 19 were previously reported in the literature (P < .001), 20 were for conditions with close relationships to those reported, and 16 were previously unreported. We found distinct incidence patterns across disease categories. Conclusions Lifetime disease risk is affected by birth month.

Phenotype-level severity is independent of the individual patient’s state and is relative to other phenotypes. Further, phenotype-level severity does not change based on the individual patient. For example, acne is mild at the phenotype-level and relative to other phenotypes. Therefore, a given patient may have a severe form of acne (this is the patient-level severity), but this does not effect its overall designation as a mild phenotype at the phenotype-level.MethodsWe present a method for classifying severity at the phenotype-level that uses the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms.

Current successful big data-driven pharmacology research comes from two major sources: population-based health record databases and molecular databases. The other driving force of big data research is the bioinformatics approach. Remarkably different from traditional hypothesis-driven research, bioinformatics resides in its natural power to inspire discovery. For example, using cutting-edge data mining methods and chemo-informatics data, Tatonetti et al. conducted association analysis between drugs, or drug interactions, and adverse events (ADEs) to assess all the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA)-approved drugs and ADEs.1 Their much-expanded pharmacovigilance research was based on the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and their local electronic medical record database (EMR). Another example is Duke et al.’s drug interaction data mining research using the EMR database.2 Their work further integrated a large-scale cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway-based pharmacokinetics interaction evidence to support epidemiological drug interaction signals identified from the EMR database. The eMERGE (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics) network is another salient example (http://www.genome.gov/27540473). It integrates both population data and genomics data with Biobank samples. Denny et al.3 extended a Biobank-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) to 86 reported disease phenotypes in the National Human Genome Research Institute GWAS Catalog using eMERGE. They successfully replicated a majority of prior GWAS associations. A comprehensive description of the impact of big data and bioinformatics in pharmacological research is documented in a recent review article.4    Bioinformatics and big data have increasingly become a core component of publications in CPT:Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (PSP). Examples are recent articles on a new drug combinatory effect prediction based on gene expression data by Goswami et al.5; and the medication-wide adverse event association analysis using medical record databases by Vilar et al.6    However, there is a major barrier in delivering reproducible and transparent scientific findings if databases are not being made available. At the same time, scientists who pull together databases are not always recognized for their effort and contribution. It is obvious that the very first data collection and processing step is absolutely critical before pharmacometrics or system pharmacology models can be developed. The data can be collected from pharmacology experiments in raw or processed format, in which the valuable information includes experimental designs and conditions. Biological and pharmacokinetics ontologies have been developed to achieve this goal.7,8 Databases can also be derived from population-based health records, in which the valuable information include data standardization and annotations, e.g., adverse event dictionaries such as MedDRA, drug dictionary RxNORM and ATC codes, lab test dictionary LONIC, etc. The other data type includes curated data and databases from the published literature. The important elements include a data curating protocol, annotation scheme, and quality controls. For example, the pharmacogenomics data curated in the PharmGKB database was well documented in a recent publication.9 All these significant database development efforts possess a tremendous value to the follow-up model development and warrant its independent recognition in publication.    The Editorial team of PSP has therefore decided to add “Database” to its article types. The scope of the Database article includes a significant effort of data collection from either pharmacology experiments, population databases, and/or is curated from the published literature or various public databases. In our PSP journal, we welcome all databases that attempt to address quantitative pharmacology-related research questions, especially relating to pharmacometrics and system pharmacology. The Introduction of the article should stress the background and significance of the data. The database development will be illustrated in the Construction and Content section, in which the data collection and quality control processes should be thoroughly documented. The scientific applications of the data shall be exemplified by case studies in the Utility section. Finally, the potential usage of the database and its pros and cons shall be discussed in the Discussion section. More detailed Database paper guidance is illustrated in Table ​1.1. An example is the recently published Database paper by Yeung and FDA coworkers, “Organ Impairment—Drug–Drug Interaction Database: A Tool for Evaluating the Impact of Renal or Hepatic Impairment and Pharmacologic Inhibition on the System Exposure of Drugs.”10 This is the first rigorously assembled database of pharmacokinetic drug exposure from publically available renal and hepatic impairment studies.11 In the article, the data curation and validation among different curators was documented, analyzed, and presented as the quality control processes. The utility of this database is demonstrated in two examples: the AUC change comparison between hepatic impairment studies and the pharmacologic inhibition of CYP3A4, and the AUC change comparison between renal impairment and pharmacologic inhibition studies. Using this database, the article concluded that the accurate estimation that the contribution of renal clearance from mass-balance studies may still be the most reliable indicator of the effect of changes in the AUC with renal impairment, while the current pharmacologic studies with available transporter inhibitors do not reflect the worst-case scenario.        Table 1    Database article guide to authors        Database articles will be reviewed and assessed based on several criteria. Obviously, the article needs to demonstrate innovation in the field of pharmacometrics and systems pharmacology. For example, what is the difference between the new database and the existing ones and what are the advantages of the new database? The article needs to show substantial effort and contribution in the data generation, collection, and the construction of the database. This can be evaluated by the amount of time, or the number of investigators, that was used to generate the data; and sometimes the cost of the data generation. The reproducibility of the database construction is very important. The article needs to provide enough documentation of a database construction process, such that the readers can regenerate the data accordingly. In addition, quality control analysis shall be provided to assess the data collection process. Also, the utility of the database shall be exemplified by a few examples. Finally, the article needs to show where and how the database can be accessed.    We expect this Database article type in PSP will provide much-needed resources to the pharmacometrics and systems pharmacology research community, and increase the impact.","",""

Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. 304 pages. ISBN 978-0-81669279-8. $25.00 USD paperback.At times, while reading The Queerness of Native American Literature, I found myself wondering for whom this book was written. I tried to imagine the audience as I negotiated my own position in reading this book. The challenges of intersectionality and multiplicity, one imagines, are that we are always occupying several, but never all, spaces. Thus, 1 read this book as a literary scholar working in queer theory, but not as a scholar working deeply and meaningfully (at least not as much as I would hope) on Native American Studies. So this book was as much an education as it was a reminder of the kinds of questions queer theory and literary studies need to be asking.Literary studies has had a troubled relationship with the canon, the Western canon, and even just the mere idea of a canon, and The Queerness of Native American Literature is certainly no exception, even as it seeks to affirm the canon's ""value."" Early on, Lisa Tatonetti explains that the project seeks to ""expand the archive"" and ""to provide new ways of seeing"" (ix). Expanding the archive often seems like a strange analogy, for the archive is a kind of limitless possibility that has been deployed in hopes of expanding the canon, but importantly, Tatonetti encourages her reader to think about new ways of seeing, of new ways of reading these texts that have, for too long, remained uncovered in the archive. In thinking about ""new ways of seeing,"" I've read this book as a timely and important intervention in literary studies and queer studies, both of which need to take account of queer and Native intellectual traditions.In many ways, what I value so much in The Queerness of Native American Literature is its treatment of canonical questions. For instance, in the second chapter, devoted to Maurice Kenny, we are asked: ""What might be learned from erotic parodies of Wordsworth, A. E. Houseman, and Byron?"" (29) Indeed, such a question requires that readers recognize the source of the parody. The author, at no point, imagines moving so far beyond the canon that the canon serves no purpose; instead, we are reminded, time and again, that the value of the canon may well be in the ways it can be subverted.A second, and perhaps more important, ""value"" that I appreciate in this work is its insistence upon close reading. In the same chapter, we read: ""Or what's to be made of a reverie on a misplaced apostrophe in a homophobic slur?"" (29) Queer theory, in the space of literary studies, is, to my mind, at its finest when it is reading closely, dealing with the finer details of its texts, and exploring what a ""misplaced apostrophe"" might mean for a given text (and Tatonetti will do just that in this chapter!).In this chapter, we also find an important critique of the work of the late Jose Munoz. Tatonetti notes that Munoz ""stops short of recognizing the importance of Indigenous voices to his project of queer recovery"" (39). While certainly true, one wonders what happens then to the Indigeneity of ""feeling brown,"" Munoz's project, or what happens to Indigenous bodies in Latino contexts. While the critique is welcomed, it is also a condition of writing: we can never write about everything. Tatonetti, thus, ""take[s] up the invitation here by arguing that if we are really to 'desire differently,' as Munoz suggests, we must listen for reverberations of queer indigeneity"" (39). Queer theory would do well to engage, to listen to, and to learn from this project of listening for those very reverberations.In the third chapter, the project of expanding the canon moves in another direction, thus, we continue ""the process of recovery, recognition, and reconnection by turning to the work of one of the most renowned authors in American Indian literature, Louise Edrich,"" and the author argues that ""queerness was always already at the heart of Indigenous literature. …","",""

The first chapter, “A Genealogy of Queer Native Literatures,” is essential to understanding the trajectory of queer Indigenous literature. Tatonetti’s research is exhaustive, providing an overview of queer Indigenous drama, poetry, fiction, and anthologies. Tatonetti notes that in the United States, Native studies scholarship has glossed over the differences between Indigenous peoples’ experiences in Canada and the United States. She acknowledges that as a nonNative scholar based in the United States, she has tried to avoid this erasure by focusing on writing in English and being published in both the United States and Canada. As a Métis scholar living in what is now Canada, I was excited by mentions of Tomson Highway (Woods Cree), Beth Brant (Bay of Quinte Mohawk), Kent Monkman (Swampy Cree), and Gregory Scofield, who is Métis and not First Nations, a sore spot for Métis people. Tatonetti’s inclusion of Indigenous writers from what is now Canada illustrates how the CanadaUS border does and doesn’t matter to Indigenous peoples. For example, Tatonetti’s assertion that Craig Womack’s (Muskogee) gorgeous Drowning in Fire is the most well-known queer Indigenous novel is certainly not applicable north of the border, where Tomson Highway’s Kiss of the Fur Queen (published in the United States by the University of Oklahoma Press), is certainly better known. Of course, nobody can be aware of all the queer Indigenous writing in English in Canada and the United States, and I hope that one day Tatonetti explores writers like Highway, Brant, and Monkman with the archival and intellectual rigor she applies to other texts. The Queerness of Native American Literature illustrates the need for similar books in Canada, México, and beyond.","",""

To do this we identify unique signatures of abnormal clinical pathology reports that correspond to pre-defined medical terms from biomedical ontologies. By using only the clinical pathology, or “lab”, reports we are able to mitigate clinical biases enabling researchers to explore other dimensions of the EHR. We used ORPheUS to generate signatures for 858 diseases and validated against reference cohorts for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF).

OBJECTIVE To develop a drug safety statistic that estimates downstream medical costs associated with serious adverse events (AEs) and unfavorable patient outcomes associated with the use of 706 FDA-approved drugs.   METHODS All primary suspect case reports for each drug were collected from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS) from 2010-2014. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was used to code serious AEs and outcomes, which were tallied for each case report. Medical costs associated with AEs and poor patient outcomes were derived from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) survey data, and their corresponding ICD-9-CM codes were mapped to MedDRA terms. Nonserious AEs and outcomes were not included. For each case report, either the highest AE cost or, if no eligible AE was listed, the highest outcome cost was used. All costed cases were aggregated for each drug and divided by the number of patients exposed to obtain a downstream estimated direct medical cost burden per exposure. Each drug was assigned a corresponding 1-100 point total.   RESULTS The 706 drugs showed an exponential distribution of downstream costs, and the data were transformed using the natural log to approximate a normal distribution. The minimum score was 8.29, and the maximum score was 99.25, with a mean of 44.32. Drugs with the highest individual scores tended to be kinase inhibitors, thalidomide analogs, and endothelin receptor antagonists. When scores were analyzed across Established Pharmacologic Class (EPC), the kinase inhibitor and endothelin receptor antagonist classes had the highest total. However, other EPCs with median scores of 75 and above included hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitor, recombinant human interferon beta, vascular endothelial growth factor-directed antibody, and tumor necrosis factor blocker. When Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifications were analyzed, antineoplastic drugs were outliers with approximately 80% of their individual scores 60 and above, while approximately 20%-30% of blood and anti-infective drugs had scores of 60 and above. Within-drug class results served to differentiate similar drugs. For example, 6 serotonin reuptake inhibitors had a score range of 35 to 53.   CONCLUSIONS This scoring system is based on estimated direct medical costs associated with postmarketing AEs and poor patient outcomes and thereby helps fill a large information gap regarding drug safety in real-world patient populations.","",""

Overexpression of c-Myc is observed in up to 30% of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common type of aggressive lymphoma. Although DLBCL can be cured in 60-70% patients, a substantial minority of patients with DLBCL still die from their lymphoma. There is emerging evidence that c-Myc expression is an adverse risk factor independent of the cell-of-origin classification. To date no drugs that directly target c-Myc have been approved for the treatment of any cancer. In fact, since c-Myc is involved in many normal cellular functions, direct c-Myc inhibitors may be associated with significant toxicity. The goal of our study is to develop novel strategies targeting c-Myc that will have an improved therapeutic index. The c-Myc protein has a very short half-life of less than 30 minutes, and its translation is highly dependent on the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F). eIF4F is activated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is regulated not only by the PI3K-AKT pathway but also the proteasome pathway. These observations led us to hypothesize that if the proteasome and PI3K pathways cooperate in the activation of mTOR and its downstream target eIF4F, then combinations of proteasome and PI3K inhibitors should potently suppress eIF4F dependent translation of c-Myc and the growth of c-Myc dependent lymphoma. Methods: Cytotoxicity was studied in lymphoma cell lines and primary lymphoma cells using Cell TiterGlo. The Bliss additivism model was used to determine the expected inhibition of cell growth. The difference of the expected and observed levels of inhibition was used to calculate the excess over Bliss (EOB) values. EOB values above 0 indicate synergy, with higher values indicating higher levels of synergy. Mechanisms of synergy were determined through interrogation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and its downstream targets. Expression of c-Myc was investigated at the translation and transcription levels, using a combination of Western blot, qPCR, and a bi-cistronic luciferase reporter we developed to study cap dependent translation. Gene expression profiling (GEP) studies were conducted using RNAseq, and analyzed by the Fisher t-test and running enrichment score (RES) between different treatment groups. Results: We used a high-throughput platform to screen the cytotoxicity of two PI3Kdelta inhibitors (TGR-1202 & idelalisib/Cal-101), two proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib & carfilzomib), and four combination pairs using these drugs. We found that TGR-1202 and Cal-101 caused only minimal to mild inhibition of lymphoma cells, while bortezomib and carfilzomib caused potent inhibition as single agents. The combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib was consistently the most synergistic doublet, while the combination of Cal-101 and bortezomib the least synergistic in numerous lymphoma cell lines studied to date (Figure 1). TGR-1202 and carfilzomib were also highly synergistic in primary lymphoma cells, while Cal-101 and bortezomib were not. Importantly, normal lymphocytes were resistant to the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib. At the molecular level, only the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib potently inhibited mTORC1 dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, leading to marked reduction of c-Myc protein (Figures 2 & 3). In contrast, the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib produced no reduction of the mRNA level of c-Myc (Figures 3). A luciferase reporter demonstrated that the synergistic combination TGR-1202 and carfilzomib specifically inhibited the translation downstream of the 59UTR of c-Myc (Figure 3). GEP studies confirmed that the canonical c-Myc target genes were potently downregulated at the level of transcription by the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (Figure 3). These results demonstrate that TGR-1202 and carfilzomib in combination potently inhibited the translation of c-Myc and the c-Myc transcriptional program, which appears to be primarily through disruption of the PI3Kdelta and proteasome pathways that converge on mTOR. Ongoing experiments are focused on confirmation of these observations in vivo. Further, a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating this combination regimen in aggressive c-Myc driven lymphomas is being planned.

The database is widely used to support post-marketing safety surveillance programs. Sometimes cited as a limitation to the usefulness of FAERS, however, is the ‘Weber effect,’ which is often summarized by stating that AE reporting peaks at the end of the second year after a regulatory authority approves a drug. Weber described this effect in 1984 based upon a single class of medications prescribed in the United Kingdom. Since that time, the FDA has made a concerted effort to improve both reporting and the database itself. Both volume and quality of AE reporting has dramatically improved since Weber’s report, with an estimated 800,000 yearly reports now being logged into FAERS.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to determine if current FAERS reporting follows the trend described by Weber.MethodsSixty-two drugs approved by the FDA between 2006 and 2010 were included in this analysis. Publicly available FAERS data were used to assess the ‘primary suspect’ AE reporting pattern for up to a 4-year period following each drug’s approval date.ResultsA total of 334,984 AE reports were logged into FAERS for the 62 drugs analyzed here. While a few of the drugs demonstrated what could be considered ‘Weber effect’ curves, a majority of the drugs showed little evidence for the effect. In fact, the general AE reporting pattern observed in this study appears to consist simply of increasing case counts over the first three quarters after approval followed by relatively constant counts thereafter.ConclusionsOur results suggest that most of the modern adverse event reporting into FAERS does not follow the pattern described by Weber. Factors that may have contributed to this finding include large increases in the volume of AE reports since the Weber effect was described, as well as a concerted effort by the FDA to increase awareness regarding the utility of post-marketing AE reporting.","",""

Medicine by Association As data get bigger, the challenge is to extract human-sized conclusions that we can comprehend and use. Li and colleagues have done exactly this by exploiting VARIMED, a hand-curated database of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with diseases or clinical parameters such as cholesterol level and smoking status, extracted from the literature. By finding pairs of diseases and these nondisease clinical parameters (which they call traits) that are associated with the same SNP variants, they construct hypotheses that the traits could be prognostic markers or risk factors for the disease. Ninety-four of the 120 pairs they identified were known and published in the literature; 26 pairs were previously undescribed. The known associations tended to fall into groups: solid organ cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and autoimmune disorders with major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–related molecules, for example. The authors were able to validate several of the newly associated traits and diseases by extracting data from electronic medical records from three clinical centers: They found that patients with abnormal mean corpuscular volume were more than three times more likely to receive a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia within a year than those with normal values. Similarly, abnormal magnesium levels predicted a greater risk of developing gastric cancer within a year, and abnormally high PSA levels predicted a doubling in the odds of receiving a lung cancer diagnosis within a year. This all in silico discovery and validation of potential risk factors for disease present an important hypothesis-generating tool for medicine. Prospective clinical trials will test whether these clinical traits can serve as informative diagnostic and prognostic markers. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for thousands of diseases and traits. We evaluated the relationships between specific risk factors (for example, blood cholesterol level) and diseases on the basis of their shared genetic architecture in a comprehensive human disease–single-nucleotide polymorphism association database (VARIMED), analyzing the findings from 8962 published association studies. Similarity between traits and diseases was statistically evaluated on the basis of their association with shared gene variants. We identified 120 disease-trait pairs that were statistically similar, and of these, we tested and validated five previously unknown disease-trait associations by searching electronic medical records (EMRs) from three independent medical centers for evidence of the trait appearing in patients within 1 year of first diagnosis of the disease. We validated that the mean corpuscular volume is elevated before diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia; both have associated variants in the gene IKZF1. Platelet count is decreased before diagnosis of alcohol dependence; both are associated with variants in the gene C12orf51. Alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in patients with venous thromboembolism; both share variants in ABO. Similarly, we found that prostate-specific antigen and serum magnesium levels were altered before the diagnosis of lung cancer and gastric cancer, respectively. Disease-trait associations identify traits that could serve as future prognostics, if validated through EMR and subsequent prospective trials.","",""

For this reason, the detection and prediction of DDIs is an important problem in both drug development and pharmacovigilance. The comparison of the 3D drug structures provides a powerful tool for DDI prediction. In this article, we present the first large scale model for predicting DDIs using the drug's 3D molecular structure. In addition to identifying putative drug interactions we can also isolate the pharmacological or clinical effect associated with the predicted interactions. The model has good performance in two different hold-out validations and in external test sets. We found that the top scored drug pairs were significantly enriched for known clinically relevant interactions and that 3D structure data is providing significantly independent information from other approaches, including 2D structure (p=0.003).

In this article, we present a novel method based on drug interaction profile fingerprints (IPFs) with successful application to DDI detection. IPFs were generated based on the DrugBank database, which provided 9,454 well-established DDIs as a primary source of interaction data. The model uses IPFs to measure the similarity of pairs of drugs and generates new putative DDIs from the non-intersecting interactions of a pair. We described as part of our analysis the pharmacological and biological effects associated with the putative interactions; for example, the interaction between haloperidol and dicyclomine can cause increased risk of psychosis and tardive dyskinesia. First, we evaluated the method through hold-out validation and then by using four independent test sets that did not overlap with DrugBank. Precision for the test sets ranged from 0.4–0.5 with more than two fold enrichment factor enhancement.

Although clinical risk factors have been identified, the syndrome remains unpredictable in an individual patient. Here we used genome-wide association analysis to search for common predisposing genetic variants. Cases of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (diTdP), treatment tolerant controls, and general population controls were ascertained across multiple sites using common definitions, and genotyped on the Illumina 610k or 1M-Duo BeadChips. Principal Components Analysis was used to select 216 Northwestern European diTdP cases and 771 ancestry-matched controls, including treatment-tolerant and general population subjects. With these sample sizes, there is 80% power to detect a variant at genome-wide significance with minor allele frequency of 10% and conferring an odds ratio of ≥2.7. Tests of association were carried out for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by logistic regression adjusting for gender and population structure. No SNP reached genome wide-significance; the variant with the lowest P value was rs2276314, a non-synonymous coding variant in C18orf21 (p  =  3×10−7, odds ratio = 2, 95% confidence intervals: 1.5–2.6). The haplotype formed by rs2276314 and a second SNP, rs767531, was significantly more frequent in controls than cases (p  =  3×10−9). Expanding the number of controls and a gene-based analysis did not yield significant associations. This study argues that common genomic variants do not contribute importantly to risk for drug-induced Torsades de Pointes across multiple drugs.","",""

However, in the setting of rare variation, accumulating sufficient samples to assess these associations can be difficult. Moreover, multiple variations in a gene or a set of genes within a pathway may all contribute to the phenotype, suggesting that the aggregation of variations found over the gene or pathway may be useful for improving the power to detect associations.ResultsHere, we present a method for aggregating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along biologically relevant pathways in order to seek genetic associations with phenotypes. Our method uses all available genetic variants and does not remove those in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Instead, it uses a novel SNP weighting scheme to down-weight the contributions of correlated SNPs. We apply our method to three cohorts of patients taking warfarin: two European descent cohorts and an African American cohort. Although the clinical covariates and key pharmacogenetic loci for warfarin have been characterized, our association metric identifies a significant association with mutations distributed throughout the pathway of warfarin metabolism. We improve dose prediction after using all known clinical covariates and pharmacogenetic variants in VKORC1 and CYP2C9. In particular, we find that at least 1% of the missing heritability in warfarin dose may be due to the aggregated effects of variations in the warfarin metabolic pathway, even though the SNPs do not individually show a significant association.ConclusionsOur method allows researchers to study aggregative SNP effects in an unbiased manner by not preselecting SNPs. It retains all the available information by accounting for LD-structure through weighting, which eliminates the need for LD pruning.","",""

Avoiding Adversity For some disease-therapy pairs, Francis Bacon was right: “The remedy is worse than the disease.” And when several drugs collide in an individual, the troubling effects can multiply. One goal of the developing field of pharmacogenomics is to make use of clinical data to predict adverse drug events so that future patients can be protected from the sometimes serious consequences. Now, Tatonetti et al. describe two new databases—one of drug effects and a second of drug-drug interaction side effects—that permit the identification of drug targets, prediction of drug indications, and discovery of drug-class interactions. Adverse drug events aren’t merely a nuisance; these toxic interactions can cause debilitating illness and death. The nature of clinical trials doesn’t allow the detection of all serious side effects and drug interactions before approval of the therapy, by regulatory agencies, for use in patients. But these agencies along with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and other institutions collect adverse event reports after the drugs are in use in the clinic. When delineated in databases and coupled with the impressive computing power now available, these reports have the potential to permit characterization of drug effects at the population level. However, even with the recent move toward electronic health records, adverse event data often lack crucial information about co-prescribed medications, patient demographics and medical histories, and the reasons that a given drug was prescribed in the first place. One can easily see how that lack of such information thwarts the ability to obtain meaningful analyses of drug side effects and interactions. To address this problem of omission and improve the ability to analyze drug effects, Tatonetti et al. use an adaptive data-driven approach to correct for the lack of such information—the so-called unknown “covariates.” Using this information, the authors developed two comprehensive databases—one of drug effects (Offsides) and another of drug-drug interaction side effects (Twosides)—and then used their new databases to pinpoint drug targets and discover drug-class interactions. Finally, the authors validated 47 of the drug-class interactions in an independent analysis of patient electronic health records. When prescribed together, widely used antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and thiazide diuretics were associated with an increase in the incidence of prolonged QT, which indicates a delayed repolarization of the heart after a heartbeat. Prolonged QT can increase a patient’s risk of palpitations, fainting, and even sudden death resulting from ventricular fibrillation. Better than tarot cards or crystal balls, the authors show that intricate analyses of observational clinical data can improve physicians’ ability to predict the future—at least with respect to as yet uncharacterized adverse drug effects and interactions. Adverse drug events remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Many adverse events are not detected during clinical trials before a drug receives approval for use in the clinic. Fortunately, as part of postmarketing surveillance, regulatory agencies and other institutions maintain large collections of adverse event reports, and these databases present an opportunity to study drug effects from patient population data. However, confounding factors such as concomitant medications, patient demographics, patient medical histories, and reasons for prescribing a drug often are uncharacterized in spontaneous reporting systems, and these omissions can limit the use of quantitative signal detection methods used in the analysis of such data. Here, we present an adaptive data-driven approach for correcting these factors in cases for which the covariates are unknown or unmeasured and combine this approach with existing methods to improve analyses of drug effects using three test data sets. We also present a comprehensive database of drug effects (Offsides) and a database of drug-drug interaction side effects (Twosides). To demonstrate the biological use of these new resources, we used them to identify drug targets, predict drug indications, and discover drug class interactions. We then corroborated 47 (P < 0.0001) of the drug class interactions using an independent analysis of electronic medical records. Our analysis suggests that combined treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thiazides is associated with significantly increased incidence of prolonged QT intervals. We conclude that confounding effects from covariates in observational clinical data can be controlled in data analyses and thus improve the detection and prediction of adverse drug effects and interactions.","",""

Spontaneous reporting systems routinely collect ADEs from patients on complex combinations of medications and provide an opportunity to discover unexpected drug interactions. Unfortunately, current algorithms for such ""signal detection"" are limited by underreporting of interactions that are not expected. We present a novel method to identify latent drug interaction signals in the case of underreporting.   MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified eight clinically significant adverse events. We used the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System to build profiles for these adverse events based on the side effects of drugs known to produce them. We then looked for pairs of drugs that match these single-drug profiles in order to predict potential interactions. We evaluated these interactions in two independent data sets and also through a retrospective analysis of the Stanford Hospital electronic medical records.

Wallace, by playing off of Mary Midgley’s Science and Poetry before moving on to Michel Houellebecq’s Atomised, challenges the “depth” of the humanistic self and warns against a simple opposition between the ostensible “richness” of the literary in contrast to the scientific tradition. Earnshaw tracks the tension between abstract values and realism, suggesting— against an overly optimistic humanistic spirit—a sense of “joyful cruelty” working through Eliot’s Middlemarch. Callus and Herbrechter close the section with one of the volume’s highlights; by reading Musil’s The Man Without Qualities alongside Agamben’s Man Without Content they consider the posthuman in the high “literary” canon as well as in technoculture. The final section—“Literature, Democracy, Humanisms from Below”—presents a more fully politicized sense of critical humanism, beginning with Arsenijević’s chapter on the contemporary poetry of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Using Benjamin as his theoretical guide, Arsenijević offers the useful notion of “unbribable life”: the voice, located in the poetic response to genocide, that insists upon equality in its resistance of political narratives. Robson’s focus is also on poetry; culminating in an analysis of Jo Shapcott’s lyric, his chapter offers an insightful consideration of the “hum” that, though situated on the border of articulacy, announces the political potential of language. Mutch turns to NineteenthCentury British Socialist periodicals, arguing for the humanizing potential of literature in contrast to the theoretical nature of Marx’s writing. The collection concludes its focus on the political efficacy of humanism by explicitly extending its concern to the task of criticism; in his examination of Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, Wood underlines the centrality of critical choice in approaching civic humanism. The overall cohesion of the collection perhaps would have benefitted from an additional parameter in its chosen materials as well as a set of concluding remarks to bring the three sections back into direct conversation. Even so, the essays of Towards a New Literary Humanism together raise necessary and timely questions in their thoughtful reconsideration of humanism’s possible future in literary studies.","",""

Current methods for post marketing surveillance primarily use spontaneous reporting systems for learning DDI signals and validate their signals using the structured portions of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We demonstrate a fast, annotation-based approach, which uses standard odds ratios for identifying signals of DDIs from the textual portion of EHRs directly and which, to our knowledge, is the first effort of its kind. We developed a gold standard of 1,120 DDIs spanning 14 adverse events and 1,164 drugs. Our evaluations on this gold standard using over 10 million clinical notes from the Stanford Hospital confirm that learning DDIs from clinical text is feasible (AUROC=81.5%). We conclude that the text in EHRs contain valuable information for learning DDIs and has enormous utility in drug surveillance and clinical decision support. Introduction Adverse drug reactions result in more than 100,000 annual deaths, with an associated yearly cost of over $136 billion, so their discovery and prevention would address one of the leading causes of death in the US. We are also witnessing a rise in polypharmacy, which is the use of multiple concomitant drugs to treat medical conditions, with many people taking 3 or more drugs. In fact, one study estimates that 29.4% of elderly patients are on 6 or more drugs. Drug interactions that lead to adverse reactions are an avoidable consequence of this practice, accounting for more than 30% of all drug reactions; and their early detection is vital. New drugs are usually tested for interactions with existing drugs before market approval using in-vivo and in-vitro methods. However, owing to the sheer number of ways by which drugs can interact, it is infeasible and expensive to test for every kind of interaction. Also, many drug interactions manifest after a certain period of exposure and it takes several exposures for rare drug interactions to occur. Therefore, post marketing surveillance is necessary to detect unanticipated interactions that occur when the drug is in use in the general population. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enables such surveillance by the active monitoring of spontaneous reporting systems (SRS) such as Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) and similarly, the World Health Organization’s VigiBase. There have been several studies that have successfully inferred drug interactions from these sources, overcoming problems of reporting biases and duplicate reporting via clever informatics. Electronic health records (EHRs) complement these existing SRSs, providing a source of observational data without the same biases. Initiatives like the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) in the US and the Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions (EU-ADR) project in Europe are focusing on building EHR based surveillance systems. These projects mainly utilize the structured diagnosis and prescription data of the EHRs for identifying single drug adverse reactions. Most efforts aimed at finding drug interactions use reported sources for signal detection and use EHRs as a means of validation. For instance, Tatonetti et. al. found 171 new drug interactions from AERS and used the EHRs at Stanford to validate them. Another study by Duke et. al. mined MEDLINE abstracts for hypothesis generation and validated the signals on EHRs. However, in addition to structured data, EHRs contain rich information in the unstructured notes and reports taken by doctors, nurses and other practitioners. By ignoring the unstructured text, we could be missing a substantial portion of adverse events. Many studies have shown that coded information like ICD-9 are inadequate to accurately build patient cohorts and there is a considerable advantage in using the unstructured clinical text of EHRs. We argue that such an advantage would also extend to drug safety signal detection. Indeed, there is already some work demonstrating the discovery of the adverse event profiles for single drugs using unstructured notes. Therefore, given increasing adoption and access to medical records for research, we expect efforts to shift more toward directly mining EHRs for signal generation with an increased attention on the use of unstructured data. In this paper, we apply data mining methods on the textual portion of EHRs to learn drug-drug interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind.","",""

As both Native and non-Native writers explained in letters and newspaper accounts, a Paiute man had awoken from an illness and prophesied a new religion that through the performance of round dance and prayer promised the whites’ disappearance, the return of dead relatives, and the restoration of decimated buffalo herds. The religion, later called the Ghost Dance, attracted Native peoples from diverse nations, including many Lakota to whom such a promise sounded especially appealing in the wake of the disease, drought, and widespread starvation their nation had faced in recent years. Despite the peaceful nature of Ghost Dance ceremonies, the large gatherings of Lakota people terrified Pine Ridge Reservation Agent Daniel Royer, an inexperienced political appointee the Lakota called “Young-Man-Afraid-Indians” (Mooney 93). On 10 November 1890, Royer had to be dissuaded from fleeing the agency with his family when words were exchanged between some of the “friendlies,” Native people working for or allied with the U.S. government, and “hostiles,” Royer’s term for and perception of the Ghost Dancers. After witnessing the heated exchange, Royer sent a series of telegrams and letters to the Indian commissioner requesting permission to return to Washington so that he might give a report in person. His first missives focused primarily on his wish to leave Pine Ridge: “Please grant me the authority to come at once. There is no immediate danger of any trouble with the Indians committing any depredations” (qtd. in Coleman 88). When his requests were denied by return telegram, Royer’s rhetoric shifted; thus, later that same day he claimed: “The craze has steadily increased until now it has assumed such proportions . . . that it is entirely beyond the control of the agent and the police force. . . .

To uncover the paroxetine-pravastatin association with high glucose effects, the investigators mined the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) (http://tinyurl.com/mbjsdt) for drug interactions with diabetes-related associations. After finding an intriguing indication that pravastatin and paroxetine taken together may influence glucose homeostasis, they retrospectively evaluated changes in blood glucose in 104 patients with diabetes and 135 without diabetes who had received both of these drugs. To accomplish this, they analyzed data in electronic medical record (EMR) systems from 3 institutions and assessedmeanrandombloodglucose levels before and after treatment with the drugs. Administration of both pravastatin and paroxetine together was associated with an average increase in blood glucose levels of 19 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) overall and 48 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) in individuals with diabetes. Neither drug administered singly was associated with such changes in glucose levels, and no increase was seen with other combinations of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and statins. “FDAAERSsometimesgets criticized as filledwithbiasesandnotuseful. It can certainlybeimproved,butithassomeuseful information, for sure,” said Altman. “Also, EMRs were really critical in our studybecause theyallowedustovalidate ourFDA-derivedpredictionsatminimal cost.” Lead author Nicholas Tatonetti addedthattheexpandingpresenceofEMR systemsrepresentsanewandgrowingopportunitytostudydrugeffectsinrealtime. “This is especially important in the case ofdrug-druginteractionswheretheeffect may not appear until a very large cohort of patients has been exposed,” he said. The researchers also looked at the impact of the 2 medications in laboratory mice that were fed a high-fat, highcalorie diet and became insulin resistant. Neither medication alone increased fasting glucose levels in these prediabetic mice, but when they were given paroxetine and pravastatin together for 3 weeks, their glucose levels increased dramatically. “Random data mining of spontaneous reports often leads to blind alleys, but this creative study used the approach to generate a wholly unexpected hypothesis that the authors were then able to confirm in observational studies of patients’ glucose levels in multiple sites, as well as in an animal experiment,” said Jerry Avorn, MD, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of the division of pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved with the work. “This is a very interesting application of informatics employed on a large scale to identify new drug-drug interactions, which are generally not well spotted in clinical trials,” he added. The approach has the potential to help expose numerous other unexpected adverse effects from different drug combinations. “Perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a super computer to do this type of research. Any modern laptop can run these algorithms in minutes,” said Tatonetti.","",""

Pharmacogenomics GWAS attempt to elucidate genotypes predictive of drug response. However, the size of these studies has severely limited their power and potential application. We propose a novel knowledge integration and SNP aggregation approach for identifying genes impacting drug response. Our SNP aggregation method characterizes the degree to which uncommon alleles of a gene are associated with drug response. We first use pre-existing knowledge sources to rank pharmacogenes by their likelihood to affect drug response. We then define a summary score for each gene based on allele frequencies and train linear and logistic regression classifiers to predict drug response phenotypes.ResultsWe applied our method to a published warfarin GWAS data set comprising 181 individuals. We find that our method can increase the power of the GWAS to identify both VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as warfarin pharmacogenes, where the original analysis had only identified VKORC1. Additionally, we find that our method can be used to discriminate between low-dose (AUROC=0.886) and high-dose (AUROC=0.764) responders.ConclusionsOur method offers a new route for candidate pharmacogene discovery from pharmacogenomics GWAS, and serves as a foundation for future work in methods for predictive pharmacogenomics.","",""

We have previously reported a method that creates a genome-scale ranking of genes likely to interact with a drug. The algorithm uses information about drug structure and indications of use to rank the genes. Although the algorithm has good performance, its performance depends on a curated set of drug-gene relationships that is expensive to create and difficult to maintain. In this work, we assess the utility of text mining in extracting a network of drug-gene relationships automatically. This provides a valuable aggregate source of knowledge, subsequently used as input into the algorithm that ranks potential pharmacogenes. Using a drug-gene network created from sentence-level co-occurrence in the full text of scientific articles, we compared the performance to that of a network created by manual curation of those articles. Under a wide range of conditions, we show that a knowledge base derived from text-mining the literature performs as well as, and sometimes better than, a high-quality, manually curated knowledge base. We conclude that we can use relationships mined automatically from the literature as a knowledgebase for pharmacogenomics relationships. Additionally, when relationships are missed by text mining, our system can accurately extrapolate new relationships with 77.4% precision.","",""

Whereas Big Eden elides indigenous identity, Johnny Greyeyes and The Business of Fancydancing segregate indigeneity from queer sexuality, thereby relegating queerness entirely to off-reservation spaces. As this essay demonstrates, when the films' protagonists cross reservation lines, they literally leave behind their queer lovers and figuratively abandon all that those lovers represent when the storylines turn nearly exclusively to familial and cultural ties. As a result, such films suggest that the boundaries of nation in indigenous contexts are constructed and maintained by the heteronormative gaze and that Two-Spirit people are therefore forced to choose between sexual and national affiliations. This theme of division, in which indigenous affiliations with tribe and nation are split from expressions of queer sexuality, demonstrates how contemporary representations of Two-Spirit identities in narrative film continue to mirror the ongoing legacy of settler colonialism. In the case of Big Eden, Indian people, and thus any potential for actual Two-Spirit erotics, vanish completely under the weight of colonial desires; in the case of Johnny Greyeyes, though the aftermath of settler violence is both highlighted and healed by invoking a Two-Spirit relationship, articulations of Two-Spirit desire are bounded by the walls of the prison; and, finally, in the case of The Business of Fancydancing, regulating settler logics, which long degraded and denied Two-Spirit cosmologies, are replicated and, in fact, reinvigorated by deploying a gay imaginary that rests on dominant constructions of queerness.","",""

(1) This beginning was followed in 1981 by Laguna author Paula Gunn Allen's essay, ""Beloved Women: Lesbians in American Indian Cultures."" During that same year, Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldua's landmark anthology This Bridge Called My Back brought two more gay Native voices to print: Hunkpapa writer Barbara Cameron, cofounder of Gay American Indians, and Menominee poet, Chrystos. Two years later, in 1983, Mohawk poet and short fiction writer Beth Brant (Bay of Quinte Mohawk) published A Gathering of Spirit: Writing and Art by North American Indian Women. The first Native-edited collection of American Indian and First Nation writing, Brant's collection included pieces by eleven Native lesbians. It would be five more years until Will Roscoe's Living the Spirit (1988), an anthology devoted entirely to the writing of gay Native people, appeared. (2) While there has been a steady rise in the publication of literary work by and about gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual/ transgender, queer (GLBTQ), and Two-Spirit Native peoples since Roscoe's 1988 collection, critical investigations of this important body of literature are just now finding representation in scholarly forums on American Indian literature. (3) Paralleling the reticence of the larger critical community regarding queer Native voices has been the troubling inclusion of both implicit and explicit homophobia in the work of influential Native writers such as Leslie Marmon Silko and James Welch. Both Silko's 1991 Almanac of the Dead and James Welch's 2000 The Heartsong of Charging Elk contain negative images of queer sexuality: in each text, gay male characters function as the site of seemingly unrelenting evil. (4) Against such a backdrop, the 2000 release of Spokane/Coeur d'Alene writer Sherman Alexie's collection of short stories, The Toughest Indian in the World, represents one of the most positive and explicit depictions of queer sexuality offered in the work of the more canonical contemporary American Indian fiction writers--Leslie Marmon Silko, Louise Erdrich, N. Scott Momaday, James Welch, and Alexie. (5) Alexie's work in The Toughest Indian is representative of his outspoken championship of queer issues. An ally to the GLBTQ/Two-Spirit community, Alexie frequently addresses the problems of homophobia in both his public speaking engagements (which often resemble standup comedy routines) and his numerous interviews. Alexie's 2002 independent film, The Business of Fancydancing, focuses on the fictional (but semi-autobiographic) experiences of a gay Native poet, Seymour Polatkin, as he negotiates the sometimes-difficult relationship between his reservation history and his present urban reality. (6) Given Alexie's prominent position in contemporary anthologies, in current syllabi, and in the eye of the reading public in the United States--Alexie has laughingly called himself the ""Indian du jour""--his representations of queer Native identity have the potential for considerable impact. My analysis here centers on the productive and markedly significant images of queer sexuality found in Alexie's The Toughest Indian in the World (2000). While Alexie's collection has at its heart the examination of human relationships in all their forms, two stories in particular bring queer identity to the fore: the title piece, ""The Toughest Indian in the World,"" which tells the enigmatic story of a Spokane journalist's first sexual experience with a Lummi Indian man; and ""Indian Country,"" which unravels the rambling tale of Low Man Smith's unplanned reunion with his white college friend, Tracy Johnson, who rescues Low Man by getting him out of jail and bringing him to the tumultuous dinner at which she meets her Spokane girlfriend's parents for the first time. …","",""

Following Moraga's lead, critics have primarily focused on the psychosexual connection between Moraga and her mother as seen in Loving in the War Years, centering much of their analysis on Moraga's revision of Malinche, a pivotal figure in Chicana literature. (1) The mother-daughter relationship in Loving in the War Years presents an origin point, however, rather than an end, for investigations into Moraga's theories of representation. By considering Loving in the War Years in conjunction with Moraga's later two texts The Last Generation (1993) and Waiting in the Wings (1997)--expanded and more complicated readings of Moraga's evolving politics become possible. Since Moraga's texts are all undoubtedly worth further (and fuller) consideration, the lack of critical attention that her later publications have received is somewhat troubling. Such silence says volumes about the expectations cultural critics place on the texts of ""minority"" writers. As Gloria Anzaldua comments: Position is point of view. And whatever position we may occupy, we are getting only one point of view: white middle-class. Theory serves those that create it. White middle-class lesbians and gays are certainly not speaking for me. Inevitably we colored dykes fall into a reactive mode, counter their terms and theories [...]. We focus on the cultural abuse of colored by white and thus fall into the trap of the colonized reader and writer forever reacting against the dominant. (""To(o) Queer the Writer"" 252) This ""trap,"" which Anzaldua specifically addresses in terms of queer writers of color, is one that critics of all ethnicities often duplicate when analyzing the work of non-white or multiethnic authors. For writers of color, as Anzaldua suggests, the trap may be defined as a recurring reaction against dominant discourses, which, by its very repetition, acts to reinstate the dominant as center. I suggest that ""white middle-class"" writers also fetishize this conflict by ignoring the texts in which Moraga moves beyond white/nonwhite binaries of identity formation. Thus, by continually situating critical conversations about Moraga's autobiographical fiction entirely around Loving in the War Years, critics remain in comfortable territory. But Cherrie Moraga's theoretical project is not about comfort. With each new text, Moraga extends her investigations of identity formation, inviting readers to follow suit. Each new book also, however, moves readers progressively away from the comfort zone in which the climax of a multiethnic author's narrative lies in a return to the ""mother"" culture. (2) Instead, the body of Moraga's work presents complicated and less tidy narratives in which Moraga examines the multivalent nature of identity. As critics have shown, Loving in the War Years is the mother's story, describing Moraga's trajectory away from and then back to the Chicano community and ending with Moraga's solid identification as a Chicana lesbian. (3) But behind the figure of the mother in at least two of her texts, Loving in the War Years and The Last Generation, lurks the omnipresent shadow of the father, a figure as yet unexamined in the critical conversation surrounding Moraga's work. In both texts, the father's ghost is a queer presence. Figured as homosexuality, whiteness, and a silencing of history, he is always creating an absence that can be filled only by a woman: a mother's frustrated passions by a daughter's lesbian sexuality, a daughter's guera [fair-skinned] privilege by a mother's Chicana heritage, a father's Anglo past by an aunt's stories. …","",""
